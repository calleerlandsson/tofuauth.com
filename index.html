    <h1>Tofu Authenticator</h1>
    <p>
    Tofu is an iOS app that generates one-time passwords to help you protect
    your online accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
    These passwords can be used in conjunction with your normal password when
    you sign into services like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
    Tofu works with all services that provide two-factor authentication using
    the HOTP and TOTP algorithms.
    </p>

    It does not require a network or cellular connection and can be used in
    airplane mode.
    </p>
